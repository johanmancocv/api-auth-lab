This folder contains a small Python script used to test a local API endpoint
that returns a 401 Unauthorized response.

The script (test_invalid_auth.py) sends a GET request to:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/unauthorized
and prints the status code to confirm that the endpoint correctly rejects
requests without authentication.

Before running the script, Python had to be installed and configured.
Initially the system showed errors like "python is not recognized", so Python
was installed, added to PATH, and Windows execution aliases were disabled.
Then the 'requests' package was installed using: pip install requests

To run the test:
python test_invalid_auth.py

Expected result:
Status Code: 401

The same endpoint was also tested manually using Postman by creating a GET
request to the same URL with no headers. Postman also returned 401, confirming
the expected behavior.

This completes the simple local authentication test.
