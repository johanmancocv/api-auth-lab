This script verifies that API authentication is working correctly after credentials have been configured.
It loads the mock credentials generated by simulate_credentials_setup.py, attaches the access token to the Authorization header, and sends authenticated requests to three mock sportsbook endpoints:

/fixtures

/odds

/settlements

For each endpoint, it prints:

the HTTP status code (expected: 200 OK)

a short snippet of the returned data

This demonstrates that the onboarding blocker has been resolved:
the API now accepts the client’s token and returns valid data.
