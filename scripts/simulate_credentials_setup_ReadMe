This script simulates the step in a sportsbook onboarding process where the API provider finally configures valid authentication credentials for the client.

It generates a file called credentials.json containing mock values:

client_id

client_secret

access_token

timestamp (issued_at)

These credentials represent a properly configured integration environment and are later used by test_valid_request.py to verify successful API authentication.

Running this script prepares the environment to transition from 401 Unauthorized to 200 OK in the validation tests.
